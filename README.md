Use the fast.ai library to develop an inference model for the [Kaggle Bike Sharing Demand
competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand).

My previous attempts were done some years ago while I was learning about ML. I naively threw a bunch of ML models in R at the problem but without a lot of effort (or success). 

I revisited the challenge after doing the first fast.ai course, using a deep-learning net. This scored much higher against the legacy leaderboard, even without any real feature engineering or tuning. Deep learning is impressive.
